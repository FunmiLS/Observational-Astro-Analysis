# Measuring the Habitability of Exoplanets Detected Using Transit Photometry


## Abstract
In this study, transit photometry was performed on flux data measured from the Kepler-4 object to detect orbiting exoplanets. Transit photometry was achieved using data normalization, Savitzky-Golay filtering, Lomb-Scargle periodograms, and curve fitting. Lightcurve analysis discovered the presence of four exoplanets, with corresponding periods of (13.1754 Â±0.0002) days, (21.7760 Â±0.0004) days, (31.784 Â±0.0016) days and (41.023 Â±0.0021) days. Planetary radius was estimated to be (2.92 Â± 0.14) RðŸœ¨, (5.11 Â± 0.22) RðŸœ¨, (3.83 Â± 0.17) RðŸœ¨, (4.05 Â± 0.18) RðŸœ¨, for planets F, E, L and S, respectively. When compared to the entire exoplanet population, it was found that the detected exoplanets had characteristics consistent to those already discovered. Analysis found that Planet-F had a mass-period relation consistent with Rocky Planets. Planet-E and Planet-L had mass-period relations consistent with super-Earth-like planets and Planet-S consistent with warm-Neptunes. Habitability was determined by assessing three areas; habitability zone, exoplanet density and escape velocity. It was concluded that none of the Kepler-4 exoplanets were habitable and the accuracy of analysis was discussed.
