# Measuring the Habitability of Exoplanets Detected Using Transit Photometry


## Abstract
In this study, transit photometry was performed on flux measured from the Kepler-4 object, in order to detect
orbiting exoplanets. Transit photometry was achieved by applying data normalisation, using a Savitzky-Golay
filter, evaluating Lomb-Scargle periodograms and applying curve fitting techniques to locate and fit exoplanet
transit curves. Lightcurve analysis discovered the presence of 4 exoplanets, with corresponding periods of
(13.1754 Â±0.0002) days, (21.7760 Â±0.0004) days, (31.784 Â±0.0016) days and (41.023 Â±0.0021) days. Planetary
radius was also estimated and found to be (2.92 Â± 0.14) RðŸœ¨, (5.11 Â± 0.22) RðŸœ¨, (3.83 Â± 0.17) RðŸœ¨, (4.05 Â± 0.18) RðŸœ¨,
for planets F, E, L and S, respectively. When compared to the entire exoplanet population, it was found that the
detected exoplanets had characteristics consistent to those of the already discovered exoplanets. It was also
found that Planet-F had a mass-period relation consistent to that of Rocky Planets. Planet-E and Planet-L had
mass-period relations consistent of super-Earth-like planets and Planet-S consistent of warm-Neptunes. The
exoplanet habitability was also analysed for detected exoplanets. It was found that none of the Kepler-4
exoplanets would be suitable candidates of habitability and the accuracy of analysis was discussed.
